# oh-shit-meeting

A calendar reminder daemon that makes sure you never miss a meeting. Serves a local dashboard in your browser and fires an obnoxiously large flashing red panic page the moment a meeting is about to start.

> **Note:** This is a quick hack by Claude Code. Use at your own risk.

## Features

- **Local dashboard** — `http://127.0.0.1:47448/` shows that the daemon is running and lists upcoming events. Each event is an accordion that expands into description, attendees, Meet link, and "Open in Google Calendar"
- **Flashing red panic page** — the same dashboard tab flips into a full-viewport alert when a reminder fires; the browser is also auto-opened/focused for good measure
- **Looping alert sound** — keeps playing until you click ACKNOWLEDGE
- **Systray icon** — calendar-shaped status at a glance: check when healthy, amber keyhole when auth needs attention, and alternating red alert frames during active alerts; "Open dashboard" / "Quit" menu. Pure-Go on Windows; gracefully no-ops where no tray host is available (e.g. WSL, some GNOME setups)
- **Google Calendar integration** — native OAuth2 (or `gws`/`gog` CLI as an explicit backend)
- **Custom reminder support** — respects your calendar's reminder settings (30m, 2h, etc.)
- **Response-aware alerts** — meetings you declined are shown as handled and never alert; unanswered invitations can be included or silenced from a persistent dashboard preference
- **Global fallback reminder** — configurable default reminder for all events
- **RSVP-aware**: declined invites never alert. Invites you have not answered get a soft nudge instead of the full panic: a native desktop toast, a blue question-mark tray icon, and a calm banner on the dashboard that clears itself after `--nudge-duration` (no sound, no browser focus, nothing to acknowledge). Nudges stack when several invites are due. Switch with `--unanswered=alert|ignore`. The dashboard preference for unanswered invitations is the master switch: with it off, unanswered invites stay silent whatever `--unanswered` says. Needs the backend to report your own RSVP, which the `google` and `gws` backends do
- **Non-blocking polling** — calendar polling runs in a background goroutine with timeouts, so alerts always fire on time even if the API is slow
- **Cross-platform audio** — macOS system sounds; generated tones on Linux/Windows (experimental, untested)
- **Deduplication** — each reminder only fires once per event instance (persisted to disk, auto-cleaned after 7 days)
- **`--display-test-alert`** — fire a synthetic alert and exit on ack, useful for dogfooding without waiting for a real meeting
- **Keychain fallback** — opt-in plaintext file storage via `--accept-insecure-secret-storage` when no system keychain is available (e.g. WSL without `gnome-keyring`)

## What it looks like

The dashboard lives at `http://127.0.0.1:47448/` (override with `--port`). In idle state it shows upcoming events as expandable cards with countdowns, attendees, Meet links, descriptions, and a link back into Google Calendar. When a reminder fires, the same page flips into a flashing red panic view with a huge ACKNOWLEDGE button and a prominent Join Google Meet button if the event has a hangout link. The browser tab is auto-focused so you can't hide from it.

The top banner separates authentication from actual calendar fetches. It shows the last successful fetch time, received and filtered event counts, and per-calendar coverage when the backend provides it. Expand **Fetch details** for the requested date range, duration, trigger and errors. **Fetch now** / **Retry fetch** requests a backend poll; successful re-authentication also requests one.

A failed or partial fetch keeps the previous complete event snapshot and marks it as potentially outdated. A successful fetch of zero events clears it. Fetch history is kept in memory, so a restarted daemon reports no successful fetch until its first complete poll.


Try it with no calendar connection required:

```bash
oh-shit-meeting --display-test-alert
```

## Prerequisites

**Recommended:** Use the built-in Google Calendar integration (no external tools needed):

```bash
# Option 1: Use a credentials JSON file from GCP
oh-shit-meeting auth --credentials /path/to/credentials.json

# Option 2: Enter client ID and secret interactively
oh-shit-meeting auth --interactive
```

To get credentials:
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console - Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app)
3. Enable the [Google Calendar API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)
4. Download the JSON file, or copy the client ID and secret

By default the daemon reads every calendar in your calendar list, which includes team, room and holiday calendars. `--calendar` limits it to the calendars you name. The requested OAuth scope follows that selection: `calendar.events.readonly` alone when a selection is set, plus `calendar.calendarlist.readonly` when reading all calendars.

All secrets (OAuth token, client secret) are stored securely in your system keychain (macOS Keychain, GNOME Keyring, or Windows Credential Manager) by default. You only need to authenticate once — re-running `oh-shit-meeting auth` reuses stored credentials.

If you're running somewhere without a working keychain (common on WSL without `gnome-keyring`, or minimal Docker images), pass `--accept-insecure-secret-storage` to opt into a plaintext JSON fallback at `~/.config/oh-shit-meeting/secrets.json` (mode `0600`). The fallback only kicks in when the keychain is actually unavailable; as soon as the keychain starts working again, the next `auth`/`Set` clears the stale plaintext entry.

**Alternative:** You can also use one of these CLI tools as an explicit backend (`--backend=gws` or `--backend=gog`):

- [gws](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli) - Google Workspace CLI
- [gog](https://github.com/steipete/gogcli) - Google API CLI tool

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/gigurra/oh-shit-meeting@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gigurra/oh-shit-meeting.git
cd oh-shit-meeting
go build .
```

No C toolchain required — the UI is a pure-Go HTTP server + your existing browser. The tray icon uses `fyne.io/systray`, which is pure-Go on Windows and needs `gcc` + `libayatana-appindicator3-dev` only on Linux/macOS (and even there the rest of the app runs fine without a tray host).

## Usage

```bash
# Authenticate with Google Calendar (first time setup)
oh-shit-meeting auth --credentials /path/to/credentials.json
# Or enter client ID/secret interactively
oh-shit-meeting auth --interactive

# Run with defaults (dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:47448/, poll every 5m, warn 5m before)
oh-shit-meeting

# Fire a synthetic alert right now (no calendar needed) and exit on ack
oh-shit-meeting --display-test-alert

# Different dashboard port
oh-shit-meeting --port=9876

# Custom settings
oh-shit-meeting --poll-interval=1m --warn-before=10m

# Different alert sound (macOS)
oh-shit-meeting --sound=Funk

# Fullscreen panic mode
oh-shit-meeting --fullscreen

# Force a specific backend
oh-shit-meeting --backend=gog

# Read only your own calendar, not every calendar you subscribe to
oh-shit-meeting auth --calendar=primary --credentials /path/to/credentials.json
oh-shit-meeting --calendar=primary

# Run somewhere without a working keychain (e.g. WSL)
oh-shit-meeting --accept-insecure-secret-storage

# List upcoming events (integration test)
oh-shit-meeting list-events
oh-shit-meeting list-events --json
oh-shit-meeting list-events --backend=gws --json

# Remove stored token (keychain + plaintext fallback)
oh-shit-meeting logout

# Run in background (fish shell)
oh-shit-meeting &; disown
```

## Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--poll-interval` | `5m` | How often to poll Google Calendar |
| `--warn-before` | `5m` | Global reminder time before meetings |
| `--fullscreen`  | `false` | Alerts shown in full-screen mode |
| `--sound` | `Hero` | Alert sound (macOS: Glass, Hero, Funk, etc. or `none`) |
| `--backend` | `auto` | Calendar backend: `auto`, `google`, `gws`, or `gog` |
| `--lookahead-days` | `3` | How many days ahead to look for events |
| `--calendar` | last auth's selection | Comma-separated calendar IDs to read (`primary` for your own, `all` for every subscribed calendar). Also narrows the OAuth scope, so pass it to `auth` too. Honoured by the `google` and `gws` backends |
| `--port` | `47448` | Port for the local dashboard HTTP server (4SHIT on a phone keypad) |
| `--display-test-alert` | `false` | Fire a synthetic alert and exit when acknowledged |
| `--unanswered` | `soft` | Invites without an RSVP: `soft` (toast + self-dismissing dashboard nudge), `alert` (full panic), `ignore` (silent). Only consulted when the dashboard preference allows unanswered invitations through |
| `--nudge-duration` | `2m` | How long a soft nudge stays visible before it clears itself |
| `--accept-insecure-secret-storage` | `false` | Allow plaintext JSON fallback when the system keychain is unavailable (available on every subcommand) |

## How It Works

1. Starts a local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:<--port>` serving a single-page dashboard; also puts a calendar status icon in the system tray where one is available
2. Polls Google Calendar in a **background goroutine** every poll interval (with 30s timeout per API call), and requests an immediate poll whenever the dashboard is loaded or refreshed, the fetch button is clicked, or re-authentication succeeds
3. Checks reminders **every second** against cached events (never blocked by polling)
4. For each upcoming event, checks:
   - Your RSVP: declined events are skipped entirely, unanswered invites are routed to the soft path (see below), accepted and tentative events get the full alert
   - Custom reminder overrides (popup reminders only)
   - Global `--warn-before` threshold
5. When a reminder triggers:
   - Creates an ack file at `~/.oh-shit-meeting/<event-id>_<start-time>/<reminder>.acked`
   - Flips the dashboard page into a flashing red panic view (via state polling — any tab open to the dashboard sees it)
   - Opens/focuses the browser so the alert comes to the front
   - Flashes the tray icon between two distinct red alert frames
   - Plays the alert sound on loop
6. Click ACKNOWLEDGE (the big white button on the panic page) to dismiss
7. When a reminder triggers for an invite you have not answered (`--unanswered=soft`, the default):
   - Sends a native desktop toast (`notify-send` on Linux, `osascript` on macOS, a PowerShell balloon on Windows), then writes the ack that suppresses it, in that order, so a failed delivery is not recorded as delivered
   - Nudges once per invite occurrence, however many reminder thresholds it passes. Each threshold still acks under its own `nudge-` prefix, so the hard alert stays armed if you accept the invite later
   - Swaps the tray icon to a blue question mark and shows a blue banner on the dashboard with Join / Respond in Calendar / Dismiss
   - Clears itself after `--nudge-duration`. Nothing blocks, nothing loops, and a real alert for another meeting still fires on top of it
   - Turning the unanswered-invitations preference off clears live nudges at once. An alert already on screen is left running, because it has already interrupted you, and ACKNOWLEDGE is its only exit
   - The tray icon only shows the question mark when auth is healthy. Auth attention always wins
8. Stale ack files are cleaned up automatically after 7 days

The dashboard endpoints (`/`, `/state`, `/ack`, `/dismiss-nudge`) are bound to loopback only, reject requests with non-loopback `Host` headers (DNS-rebinding defence), and require a same-origin `Origin` on unsafe methods. ACK requires the exact reminder ID of the currently active alert.
